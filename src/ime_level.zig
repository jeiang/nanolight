//! Input methods' candidate windows over the panel (issue #39). The panel
//! is a popover at the pop-up menu level (101); the system's candidate
//! window, Chinese Pinyin's row of characters, sits at level 20, behind
//! it, unless the text input client says how high its window is. AppKit
//! asks with NSTextInputClient's optional `windowLevel` and lifts the
//! input method's window above that level. nanoui's view doesn't answer
//! it, so the panel's view class gets it here: no activation, the panel
//! keeps its level and stays non-activating.
